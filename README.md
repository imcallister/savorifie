# savorifie

Implementation of a django-based accounting and reporting system with a node backend for the ledger.

The full deploy requires [accountifie-svc](https://github.com/electronifie/accountifie-svc/) for ledger backend and [accountifie](https://github.com/electronifie/accountifie/) for the core accounting and business logic.
These were open-sourced by Electronifie. 
An ansible deploy script is coming shortly showing how the pieces fit together.

The savorifie implementation is for a small customer-goods company [Savor Goods](http://www.savor.us).
Eletronifie's own implementation is for a broker-dealer (not open-source) but shows that the code has been applied to very different types of companies.
